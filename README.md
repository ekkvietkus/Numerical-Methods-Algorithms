## Numerical-Methods-Algorithms
These algorithms were developed during the Spring Semester of MECH 105 in 2018. Most of these algorithms are used to numerically calculate something, they are not analytical solutions *(and thus might be less accurate than built-in MATLAB functions)*.   
  
Within each file there are two items:  
1. A MATLAB .m file that contains the algorithm itself.  
2. A README .md file that contains instructions on how to use said algorithms.  
*The README contains information required for the code to run smoothly*
  
**These .m files require MATLAB (or Octave) to run correctly!**
